Over the course of February 3-4 during the 2025 Spring semester of DIS in Copenhagen, the Game Programming core course held a Game Jam.

Given the theme of "one button," we created a game that only uses one button: the space bar. Press the space bar to rotate the food item to align with the incoming arrows. But there's a twist... will you figure out what it is?
